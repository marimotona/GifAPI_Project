# GifAPI_Project

I created a website using the Gif API for a personal project at waffle college!
## Project Description

Using the Gif API, I created a website that displays Gif images when a search word and the number of searches are entered.

I wrote code in JavaScript and built a local server with Node.js and Express

After creating the website, the students compiled what they had learned through the creation of the website into a slide presentation, 
and held a presentation among the Waffle College members.
